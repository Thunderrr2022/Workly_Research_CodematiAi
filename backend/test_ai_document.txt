Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. AI systems use machine learning algorithms to analyze data, recognize patterns, and make decisions. Modern AI applications include natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and autonomous systems. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to process complex data.
